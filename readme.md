## Overview

The Auto Attendance System is a Python application that allows teachers to automatically take attendance in a classroom. The application uses a Wi-Fi network scanner to detect the presence of students' devices in the classroom. For each student whose device is detected, the application marks the student as present in the attendance system.

The Auto Attendance System is designed to be easy to use. To use the application, teachers simply need to start the application and connect it to the classroom Wi-Fi network. The application will then automatically scan for devices and mark students as present. Teachers can also manually mark students as present or absent.

The Auto Attendance System is a valuable tool for teachers who want to save time and improve the accuracy of their attendance records. The application is also a great way to ensure that all students are present in class.
